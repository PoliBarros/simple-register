# simple-register

Simple project to show what I learned in college about Pyhton and Tkinter.

## Prerequisites
- Have Mysql and Python 3+ installed
- Install mysql-connector-python in the same path of the project, you can do this using the Pycharm terminal, View > Tool windows > Terminal execute the command: pip install mysql-connector-python.
- Install MSql database and create a connection using root and NO password.

**PS:** If you already have MySql installed but username and password are different, 
you need to change these information on file called **DataBaseConnection.py** on lines 14, 28, 51 and 75 of this file.

## How to run
1. Run the file GUI > LoginGUI.py
2. The database created is called proj_emerging_tech
3. Username: adm and password: 1234, keep the option ADM on input Select the type to login. 
4. Click Login or press Enter from keyboard.
